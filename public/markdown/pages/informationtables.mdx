# Information Tables

Each Operating System Page includes an Information Table designed to prioritise key information about the operating system.

The information in Information Tables is pulled from Embedded Metadata, which is powered by Markdown technologies internally.

Every Information Table includes the project's category tag and popular platforms available. Most operating systems also show what it is based on, it's preinstalled desktop, default package manager, and default shell. However, aside from the category and platform rows, metadata is only shown if it applies to that project. For example, the Preinstalled Desktop row only appears on projects that use graphical user interfaces. There's a whole assortment of available metadata available - see [Embedded Metadata](docs/reference/embedded-metadata) for a comprehensive reference.

Limited metadata also appears on the Operating System List and in many Search options.

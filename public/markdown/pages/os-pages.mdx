# Operating System Pages

Each operating system on ULOSINO has it's own Operating System Page. OS Pages are dynamic spaces for OS descriptions, [information tables](/docs/pages/informationtables), links to related information, and links to [ULOSINO Tempo](/docs/tempo) options.

## Components

Operating System Pages are made of three key elements.

First there is the description. Then are two sections. There are the links along the top, with information tables underneath.

> **Note:** On desktop, these are to the left and right respectively.

### Description

The description covers most of the page. It's powered by [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) technologies.

The description is a full paragraph covering most aspects of the operating system project. Interesting and unique aspects of the project are highlighted and market position is raised. Descriptions are designed to give you a lot of what you should know about that particular project.

### Links

Next is the links hub. With this hub, you can visit the project's website or their source repository, or donate using ULOSINO Tempo.

> **Note:** Links only appear if they are available.

> **Note:** The ULOSINO Tempo link won't be shown on any OS [if Tempo is disabled](/docs/tempo/disable).

### The Information Table

Finally each OS Page includes an information table. The table aims to give you a quick overview of the project. More details are available on the [Information Tables](/docs/pages/informationtables) page.

## View on GitHub

Each operating system page also offers a link to its place within our GitHub repository. This is helpful for those who want to contribute to the project.

# Preferences

ULOSINO gives you the power to change how the app looks and behaves.

Most preferences are stored by your browser on your computerÂ so that they stay the same each time you use ULOSINO.

To change your preferences, open Preferences:

- On desktop, select the gear button on the right side of the navigation bar.
- On mobile, select Menu and then Preferences.

Preferences are grouped into Appearance, Notifications, and Advanced groups. Appearance and Notification preferences change how ULOSINO looks and feels, while Advanced preferences change advanced application settings and behaviours.

- On desktop, use the sidebar to toggle each group and reveal different options.
- On mobile, select a group from the list to reveal the options in that group.

# Transfer Preferences

Let's say you've really customised The Friendly Flow. Now you're using another browser and you don't know how to apply the preferences you're used to!

Don't worry. Preferences are mapped to Preference Codes and you can enter your Preference Code on another browser or device to apply the same preferences.

To do this:

1. Open Preferences, select Advanced and then Open Preference Transfer (Beta) on the source browser.
2. Copy the Current Preference Code for the source browser.
3. Repeat step 1 on the target browser.
4. Enter the code from step 2. on the target browser.

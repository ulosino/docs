# Low Battery Performance Restrictions

ULOSINO attempts to reduce it's resource usage by turning off certain features when your device's battery is critically low.

---

## Disable Performance Restrictions

To turn off performance restrictions:

- Connect your device to the charger
- Continue charging until your device reaches 7% battery level.

> **Tip:** It is recommended you wait until 10% before using the disabled features, which are described below.

---

## Features Disabled Under Performance Restrictions

Some ULOSINO features can be intensive on system resources, and therefore further decrease your device's battery life.

These features are disabled when the battery is critically low:

- Advanced Search
- Reset Preferences
- Transfer Preferences
- Some background services

In addition, some presentation elements like animations and transitions are also disabled.

## Supported Browsers

Some web browsers do not support the [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API). As a precautionary measure, and to prevent [application errors](/docs/reference/errors), performance restrictions are not introduced on these browsers:

- Safari (Mac)
- All iOS and iPadOS browsers, including Safari (all browsers on iOS must use WebKit technology)

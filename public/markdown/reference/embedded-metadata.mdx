# Embedded Metadata Definitions

This reference document explains how to use embedded metadata in ULOSINO markdown files.

---

## Example

All ULOSINO markdown files include embedded metadata stored in a key-value pair. This technically called YAML. In a .mdx file, embedded metadata looks like this:

```
---
key: "value"

# Other fields...
---

Hello world...

```

The `---` lines encapsulate the metadata. The last one separates the metadata from the rest of the file.

## Recognised Embedded Metadata

> **Note:** `name`, `summary`, `date`, `platform` and `version` are required for sorting. All other metadata fields will be hidden if they have no value.

> **Warning:** `donate`, `donateGithub`, `donateLiberapay`, and `donateOpenCollective` must be included in the file. If donation features aren't used for that page, the field needs to be commented out, not just left out.

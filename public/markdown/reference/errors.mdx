## Integrated Application Errors (IAEs)

ULOSINO handles application errors using Integrated Application Errors. More details may be available in the browser console.

### `BrowserNotPermitted`

The browser that is being used to access ULOSINO isn't supported. Try using a different browser.

### `FeatureIsDisabled`

The feature has been manually disabled by the user (non-default behaviour). Try [restoring the default preferences](/docs/preferences/restore).

### `ErrorRegionCaught`

An error was found in a region of the page which was covered by a fallback (`<ErrorFallback>`).

### `ErrorInUndefinedRegion`

An error was found in a region of the page which was not covered by a fallback.

Because there is no region-scope fallback, the renderer renders an application-scope fallback (`<ErrorFallbackApplication>`), which crashes the application.

To return to ULOSINO, refresh the page.

## Request Errors

We've built custom fallbacks for the common HTTP 404 ("Page Not Found") and HTTP 500 ("Internal Server Error") errors.

We've also built a custom fallback when the browser is offline.

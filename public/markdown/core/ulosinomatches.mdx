## Finding a Match

Once you've opened Matches, you'll find a series of buttons that change the results. The buttons toggle the opposite of what is described and they are called switches.

The core concept is that you can switch these switches into a combination that will give you the operating systems you want. In this way it is similar to a survey, but the experience is actually more like a dynamic matching system.

Below the switches, you will find a list of operating systems. This list changes depending on the state of the switches.

## Getting More Information

Simply select an operating system from the list and you'll be taken to it's page on ULOSINO.
